# For this project, I loaded data into RStudio in order to clean and analyze it using R.
# First, I installed the tidyverse package and loaded relevant libraries:

install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)

# Then, I loaded and aggregated the 12 separate .csv files so that these data were accessible and organized.
